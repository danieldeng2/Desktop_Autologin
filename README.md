# Desktop_Autologin
Auto login as an java program. It should work on all devices capable of running Java (including Mac, Linux, Windows). 
You could run it by installing Java on your computer and running 'java -jar Path_to_file/AutoLogin.jar' from console, you could then link the command to keyboard shortcuts if you want to. 
To add keyboard shortcuts in Windows, Create new folder in C:/ProgramFiles/AutoLogin/ and copy the AutoLogin.jar there. 
Create a new shortcut on Desktop linking to AutoLogin.jar, then right click, properties, keyboard shortcuts. 
To do the same in Ubuntu, go to devices, keyboard, add custom shortcuts, and add 'java -jar Path_to_file/AutoLogin.jar'.
